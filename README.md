# Bioinspired Robotics - Stingray Inspired Undulator

This code powers the Arduino powered stingray robot created during the University of Maryland's Summer 2025 Immersive Research Internship Experience. The code primarily focuses on powering four stepper motors on both sides through a controller while utilziing an undulating motion via I2C connection between one master Arduino and two slave Arduino's. In order to power this undulating motion, the code uses the AccelStepper library, a helpful library for simultaneously controlling motors.

## Project Results and Thoughts
- If I were to continue this project, I would figure out how to create an angle change between the fins and allow the stingray to become "amphibious"
