# Bioinspired Robotics - Stingray Inspired Undulator

This code powers the arduino powered stingray robot created during the University of Maryland's 2025 Immersive Research Internship Experience. The code primarily focuses on powering four stepper motors on each side through a controller while utilziing an undulating motion using an I2C connection between one master Arduino and two slave Arduino's. In order to power this undulating motion, the code uses the AccelStepper library, a helpful library for simultaneously controlling motors.
